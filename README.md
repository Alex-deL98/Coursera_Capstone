# Coursera_Capstone
Repository for my capstone project on scraping data on postal codes in Toronto from Wikipedia, clean the data appropriately then load it into a dataframe.

Once in a dataframe, I will gather data on the most common venues in each neighbourhood using the Foursquare API, and then use the K-nearest-neighbours algorithm to group the neighbourhoods together according to the different venue types.

Finally, I will then visualise the results on a map using the Folium library.
